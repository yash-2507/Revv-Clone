              While taking the delivery of your car, you will need to show your
              ORIGINAL Driving License and ID proof (same as the ones whose
              details you provided while making the booking). These documents
              will be verified for validity. In case these documents are
              unavailable/invalid/unverifiable, your booking will be subject to
              cancellation. Revv’s decision in this matter will be final and
              binding. Please note that driving license printed on A4 sheet of
              paper (original or otherwise) will not be considered as a valid
              document.

              Our delivery executive will deliver the car to your doorstep.
              Before he hands- over the car to you, he will share with you a
              pre-filled checklist that summarises the car’s condition at that
              time. Please confirm the details in the checklist, sign it and you
              are good to go. In case any information in the checklist is not
              correct, please notify the delivery executive or call us.
